# Bubbl Extra Bold
Bubbl Extra Bold is a fun and bold display font with a bubbly vibe. Great for all sorts of projects, it includes a broad selection of characters suitable for many Latin-based scripts and more. 

## Overview
Welcome! This project is where I refine my skills, so it's continually evolving. Each release is essentially a 'beta' version - a space for growth and improvement. Expect some shifts in glyph forms with different updates; it's all part of the development process and my journey in mastering this craft.
